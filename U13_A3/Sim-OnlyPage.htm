<p>Sim-only deals are fantastic value for money. There's no need to tie yourself into a monthly phone contract, but you can still get all of the benefits of a great package from your chosen network. If you already have a great phone that you want to keep using or your just not looking for a new one right away, a SIM only deal is the way to go. You get just the SIM card with your chosen data, minutes and text and other great perks too. Take a look at our options and available networks to compare SIM only deals.</p>

<p>We have some of the best SIM only deals available, with top networks including Vodafone, Three and Smarty to choose from. Filter our deals by network, contract length, monthly costs and even which deals include 5G or cashback to find the perfect option for you. A choice of contract lengths means you can commit for however long you're comfortable with. Pick a rolling 1-month contract for complete flexibility or get some great savings by committing for longer, with a 12, 18 or 24-month contract.
