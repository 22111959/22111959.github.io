<h1>Unit 14</h1>

<p>In unit 14 it was all about installing and maintaning computer hardware where I did loads of assignments to do with unit 14 with one being Cambria Creatives would like me to upgrade and maintain the hardware in one technology system (the desktop). My task was to plan the installation and maintenance of hardware to fulfil the user requirements for the client. I did complete the assignment after getting my feedback and after some changes I had to make that were wrong, but the assignment was pretty straightfoward</p>
