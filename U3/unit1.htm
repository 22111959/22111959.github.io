<h1>Unit 1</h1>

<p>Unit 1 was about the online world. I will cover everything that I did for unit 1 in this paragraph, I had my first exam of the year on unit 1 that did on the 24th april 2024. At first I thought I was doing really well answering the questions and doing the tick boxes but when I got to the later pages it was getting increasingly tougher and I was starting to struggle more, it took me about 47 minutes to complete the examination. After I completed the unit 1 exam I ended up retaking and the second time around I passed because I did more revising this time which helped me remember alot more, I even thought the revision itself was harder than the exam the second time.</p>
