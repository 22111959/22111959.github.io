<h1>Unit 2</h1>

<p>Unit 2 was about technology systems where there were plenty of tasks to do with different types of technology system such as manufacturinf technolohgy, banking technology, network technology and many more. Unit 2 was my second exam of the year and is the one that I did alot of revising for by completing most of the sample tests that are in the google classroom for unit 2. In this exam I answered all of the questions whether I knew them or not. I did pass after getting my result back but it was a result that I felt like I could've done better on but its done now there is nothing I could do to better it.</p>
